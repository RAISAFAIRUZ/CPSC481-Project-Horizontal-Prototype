SUGGESTIONS for running admin side: Adding, editing, removing works on local storage as well as some are hard coded to show both prototype and complete walk through
1. Add a category first 
2. You can edit that catagory or description
3. Add Two photos, you can edit them it saves the changes 
4. Once the photo as been added under a catagory, from the shop page category drop down the photographer can see that picture added
the picture gets added to the full library and to that specific category as well
5. Click the added picture and remove, it removes that picture from both the full library and the category
6. Now if the photographer goes back to edit the catagory and deletes the catagory, the catagory and all pictures associated with it gets deleted
